# Collaboration

MyST allows multiple users to edit a document simultaneously. You can see how many users are editing a document by their avatars in the topbar. Each user has a username and a color. You can see the colored cursors of other users in the editor with their usernames attached, while your cursor will be a simple vertical bar. Whenever someone makes a selection it will also be shown

## Connection Issues

![Connection Error](./assets/conn-error.png)

If you run into connection problems an error will be displayed and the editor will be locked. In such a situation please check your internet connection and restart the editor. If you do have internet access, the collaboration server might be offline.

```{warning}
Changes made in the editor while offline would are lost, but a connectivity error should lock the editor and prompt you for a restart. Please keep this in mind.
```
