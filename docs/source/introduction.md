# Introduction

MyST Editor is a collaborative Markdown editor. It uses [MyST](https://mystmd.org/) - a Markdown flavor meant for technical documentation.
For a general introduction to the MyST syntax, please refer to [MyST Markdown Guide](https://mystmd.org/guide/quickstart-myst-markdown).
The goal of this manual is to introduce and describe how to use all the editor features effectively.
