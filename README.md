# MyST editor tests

This is a MyST editor in preact/html.

The demo is commited here with hardcoded commits (due to CDN caching preventing us from just using the tip of main), but should most likely be generated in CI to make all this more flexible.

It would most likely make sense to rewrite this to a Svelte component (or the like), which will require compilation, but perhaps it's the only hway.

A demo should be deployed at https://mgielda.github.io/preact-test/
