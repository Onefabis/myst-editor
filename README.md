# MyST editor tests

This is a MyST editor in preact/html.

It might make sense to rewrite this to a Svelte component (or the like), which will require compilation, but for now it seems we can make it work without having to compile anything.

A demo should be deployed at https://mgielda.github.io/preact-test/
