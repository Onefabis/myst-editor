# MyST Editor

Copyright (c) 2022 Antmicro

This is a MyST editor in Preact component, using [htm](https://github.com/developit/htm) as the templating language.

It might make sense to rewrite this to a Svelte component (or the like), which will require compilation, but for now it seems we can make it work without having to compile anything.

A demo should be deployed at https://mgielda.github.io/myst-editor/
